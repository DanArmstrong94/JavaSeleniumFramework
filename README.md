# Java Selenium Framework

Basic Java Selenium Framework for developing automated end to end browser tests.

# Running the Tests
 
 In order to run these tests, you will need java and maven installed and configured on your machine.
 
 From a terminal, run:

```
 mvn clean package
```
 
Or, if you are using IntelliJ, you can run individual Senarios and Feature files from within the code by simply adding:
```org.framework``` to your Cucumber Run Configuration, as the Cucumber Glue.
